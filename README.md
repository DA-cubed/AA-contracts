# DA(cubed) custom contracts and scripts

Participation in the DAO is represented by (voting) token, therefore the paymaster which pays for participant's
transactions checks the balance of this user and depending on the value validates UserOperation or no.

Contract: `contracts/samples/Paymaster.sol`

The rest in this repository are debugging, deploying and setting up scripts in `scripts/`.


This repo was originally forked from eth-infinitism.
